   * FreeLore

     A goal of the FreeLore Project is to do "serious" book-length writing,
     and give it away for free.  John Goodwin is now concentrating on writing
     freelore and to show what it is by example (not unlike the FSF).  You can
     FTP his results from `world.std.com' in `/obi/Networking/John.Goodwin'.
     To volunteer, contact `jgoodwin@delphi.fnal.gov'.

   * The Online Book Initiative (OBI)

     OBI focuses on freely redistributable books, reference material,
     conference proceedings, catalogues, etc.  OBI has about 400MB of (mostly
     compressed) text online, ranging from poetry to standards documents to
     novels.  You may anonymous FTP texts from `obi.std.com' in `/obi'.  You
     can also dial `world.std.com' with a modem (617-739-9753, 8N1) and
     create an account to access this information (login as `new').  Accounts
     on `world' are charged for their connect time (ask `info@world.std.com'
     for details).

   * Project Gutenberg

     Project Gutenberg is the brainchild of Michael Hart.  Professor Hart's
     hope for success derives from the nature of what he calls `Replicator
     Technology'.  Once anything is stored in a computer, it can be reproduced
     indefinitely, making it available to all who want it.  Texts from
     Project Gutenberg are available at a number of FTP sites, including
     `mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu' in file `/etext' and `oes.orst.edu' in file
     `/pub/almanac/etext'.  To find out how to obtain text via e-mail, send
     the word `HELP' in the body of a message to
     `BITFTP%PUCC.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu'.  Or look at
     `bit.listserv.gutnberg', a USENET newsgroup.  For more information,
     write to `dircompg@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu'.

   * Project Runeberg
