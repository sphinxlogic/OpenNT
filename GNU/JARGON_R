The Jargon File is the definitive compendium of hacker slang.

We make at least the newest and oldest versions of the Jargon File
available here.

jargon.text.z
	the original MIT/Stanford AI jargon file.

jarg300.txt.gz
	The 3.0.0 version, corresponding to the second paper edition from
	MIT Press.  1961 entries.

jarg300.info.gz
	Version of the above suitable for info browsing.

jargon-upd.gz
	All new and changed entries since 2.9.6.

  Entries with only trivial changes (spelling, punctuation,
references, minor changes of phrasing) have been omitted from the
change list.

Some archive sites will also include the following, depending on free
space available and the sysadmin's whim:

jargon296.ascii.z 
	the sixfold-expanded version published in 1991 as
	"The New Hacker's Dictionary" by MIT Press.  This is the entire
	text, except for Guy Steele's and Eric Raymond's introductions
	and the "vietnam wall" credits list at the end (and of course
	no fancy fonts and cartoons).  1702 entries.

jargon298.ascii.z
	Jan 01 1992 update, with corrections and new entries.  1760 entries.

jargon299.ascii.z
	Apr 01 1992 update, with new entries from XEROX PARC and elsewhere.
	1821 entries.

jargon2910.ascii.z
	Jul 01 1992 update, with new entries and much additional
	historical material.  1891 entries.

jargon2911.ascii.z
	Jan 01 1993 update.  1922 entries.

jargon2912.txt.z
	May 10 1993 update.  Last revision before the 3.0 freeze
	for TNHD's second edition.  A few terms have been deleted,
	mostly game-specific slang from the MUD community.  1946 entries

Also note that vh-1.5.tar.gz contains sources for a hypertext reader
handy for browsing the File.
