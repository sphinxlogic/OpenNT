The Lily (LIsp LibrarY) C++ class library gives C++ programmers the
capability to write LISP-style code.

Lily is probably useful in academia for instructors who want to teach
artificial intelligence techniques with C++.  The garbage collection
mechanism employed by Lily is slow which may make it unattractive for
commercial use.

It is available via anonymous ftp from sunsite.unc.edu (152.2.22.81) as the
file `/uploads/lily-0.1.tar.gz'.
