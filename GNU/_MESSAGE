If you have problems downloading and are seeing "Access denied" or
"Permission denied", please make sure that you started your FTP client in
a directory to which you have write permission.

Please note that all files ending in `.gz' are compressed with `gzip', not
with the unix `compress' program.  Get the file README and read it for more
