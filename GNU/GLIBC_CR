The GNU C library now includes Michael Glad's Ultra Fast Crypt, which
provides the Unix `crypt' function, plus some other entry points.  Because
of the United States export restriction on DES implementations, we are
distributing this code separately from the rest of the C library.  There is
an extra distribution tar file just for crypt; it is called
`glibc-1.07-crypt.tar.gz'.  You can just unpack the crypt distribution
along with the rest of the C library and build; you can also build the
library without getting crypt.  Users outside the USA can get the crypt
distribution via anonymous FTP from ftp.uni-c.dk [129.142.6.74], or another
archive site outside the USA.  Archive maintainers are encouraged to copy
this distribution to their archives outside the USA.  Please get it from
ftp.uni-c.dk; transferring this distribution from prep.ai.mit.edu (or any
other site in the USA) to a site outside the USA is in violation of US
export laws.
