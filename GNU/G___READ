G++ is no longer a separate distribution.  Version 2 of G++ is an integral
part of GCC.  You should get the gcc-2.n.tar.gz sources (where n is the
highest numbered archive) in this directory.

C++ users will almost certainly need to retrieve the libg++-2.n.tar.gz
distribution as well, since that's where all the standard C++ stream classes
(and header files like iostream.h) live.
