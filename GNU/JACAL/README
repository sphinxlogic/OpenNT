This message announces the availability of Scheme release scm4e1.

New in scm4e1 are:

	* eval.c (copytree): now copies vectors as well.
	* repl.c (quit): now accepts #t and #f values.
	* repl.c (repl): call to my_time() moved to not include READ time.
	* time.c (LACK_FTIME LACK_TIMES): defined for vms.
	* time.c (mytime): now prefers to use times() over clock().
	Compilation constant CLOCKS_PER_SEC doesn't scale when a binary is
	moved between machines.
	* Init.scm (*SCM-VERSION*): added.
	* Makefile (intro): Added message for those who just make.
	Cleaned up and reorganized Makefile.
	* patchlvl.h (PATCHLEVEL): removed.  Whole version now just in
	SCMVERSION.
	* unif.c (clist2uve clist2array): removed.

	From: rshouman@chpc.utexas.edu (Radey Shouman)
	* unif.c: no longer uses pointer comparisons in loops.  Should
	fix array problems on 8086 processors.
	* unif.c (make_sh_array): Fixes MAKE-SHARED-ARRAY so that shared
	arrays with only 1 element in some direction may still be
	ARRAY-CONTIGUOUS?
	(uve_write uve_read): Fixes bug in UNIFORM-ARRAY-WRITE,
	UNIFORM-ARRAY_READ!.  Now they do the right thing for shared
	bit-arrays not starting at the beginning of their contents vector.
	(array_contents ARRAY-SIMPLE?): ARRAY-CONTENTS may now return a
	shared, contiguous, 1-d array, instead of a vector, if the array
	cannot access all of the contents vector.  ARRAY-SIMPLE? removed.
	(array-fill!): a replacement and generalization of
	UNIFORM-VECTOR-FILL!.
	(raequal): Combines with uve_equal(), providing also ARRAY-EQUAL?
	ARRAY-EQUAL? is equivalent to EQUAL? if all its arguments are
	uniform vectors or if all are arrays.  It differs from EQUAL? in
	that a shared, 1-d array may be ARRAY-EQUAL? to a uniform vector.
	  for example
	  (define sh (make-shared-array '#(0 1 2 3) list '(0 1))) ==> #1(0 1)
	  (equal? '#(0 1) sh)       ==> #F
	  (array-equal? '#(0 1) sh) ==> #T
	(list2ura): Combines list2uve() and list2ura().
	* sys.c (sfgetc): can now return EOF.
	* Init.scm ((read:array digit port)): added.  Most # syntax
	handled in read:sharp.
	* repl.c (iprin1): Characters higher than 127 print as
	#\<octal-number>.

	* macscm.tar.Z: Macintosh applications building package which
	works with SCM (similar to XSCM).

Scm conforms to Revised^4 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme
and the IEEE P1178 specification.  Scm is written in C and runs under
Amiga, Atari-ST, MacOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, NOS/VE, Unicos, VMS, Unix and
similar systems.  ASCII and EBCDIC are supported.

Documentation is included explaining the many Scheme Language
extensions in scm, the internal representation and how to extend or
include scm in other programs.
