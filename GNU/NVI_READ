nvi is a free implementation of the vi/ex Unix editor.  It has almost all
the functionality of the original vi/ex, except ``open'' mode and the lisp
option, which will be added.  Enhancements over vi/ex include split screens
with multiple buffers, ability to handle 8-bit data, infinite file and line
lengths, tag stacks, infinite undo, and extended regular expressions.  nvi
runs under BSD, Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, BSDI, AIX, HPUX, DGUX, IRIX, PSF,
PTX, Solaris, SunOS, Ultrix and Unixware.  It should be easy to port to
many other systems.

nvi is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in the
directory /ucb/4bsd/.

nvi is also available directly from the GNU Project on the `Utilities'
distribution tape and Source Code CDROM.  For more information, please ask
gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.
