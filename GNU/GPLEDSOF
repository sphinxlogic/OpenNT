   * GN, a hybrid Gopher and WWW server

     GN is a hybrid Gopher and WWW (the Internet's World Wide Web) server.  It
     is written by John Franks in C and runs under UNIX.  GN serves two
     protocols gopher0 and HTTP/1.0 used by WWW clients.  GN recognizes the
     protocol from the request and responds appropriately.  For further
     information see `http://hopf.math.nwu/' or `gopher://hopf.math.nwu', or
     contact `john@math.nwu.edu'.  You can FTP it from `ftp.acns.nwu.edu' in
     file `/pub/gn/gn-2.07.tar.gz'

   * SNePS Now Free Software

     The current release, 2.1, of the Semantic Network Processing System
     (SNePS), is publicly available under the terms of the GNU General Public
     License.  Previously it was available for a licensing fee.

     SNePS is the implementation of a fully intensional theory of
     propositional knowledge representation and reasoning.  SNePS 2.1 runs in
     CLISP on PCs under DOS or Unix.  Previous versions ran on AKCL (now
     known as GNU Common Lisp (GCL)).  SNePS can be obtained by anonymous FTP
     from `ftp.cs.buffalo.edu' in `/pub/sneps'.  For more information, get
     the `README' file.

   * GAMMA: a Magnetic Resonance Simulation Library

     GAMMA is an object oriented package for magnetic resonance simulation by
     numerical density matrix calculation.  It is written in C++.

     The package contains definitions for complex data types such as
     matrices, operators or spin systems, and appropriate mathematical
     operations on them.  You can write a simulation program in a natural way
     that parallels the abstract formalism used for a theoretical
     description.  The simulation environment is fully user expandable.

     The library is currently available under the GPL license on
     `hertz.ethz.ch'.

   * Moldy, A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Program

     Moldy is a molecular dynamics simulation program written by Keith
     Refson.  He says, "... I have a slightly unusual rationale for using the
     GPL ..."

          For the last few hundred years or so there has been a principle
          which forms part of the ethos of scientific endeavour.  It is that
          the fruits of one's research should be openly published so that
          others may learn, use and build upon them.  Results may be
          independently checked by other researchers, contributing to the
          reliability which distinguishes science from other forms of
          knowledge.  And the benefits are available to the general good.  Of
          course such a high ethical principle is not always honoured,
          scientists being human and subject to the usual commercial
          pressures.  But it remains as an ideal to strive for.

          I have placed my molecular dynamics simulation program, called Moldy
          under the GPL because I find the copyleft conditions in close
          agreement with this spirit of scientific freedom and co-operation.
          It is a research tool for performing atomistic computer simulations
          of solids and liquids, and therefore not of widespread use outside
          the discipline.  I wish to make it available to any scientist who
          wishes to use it, to encourage them to add to the program and to
          ensure that any improvements are as free as the original code.

     Moldy come with a manual in LaTeX or PostScript format; it runs on Unix,
     VMS and MS-DOS systems.  The sources are available by anonymous FTP from
     `earth.ox.ac.uk'.

   * Map: the Interactive Network Map

     Map, the Interactive Network Map is a part of a network management
     system.  It presents a map of a network and allows point and click
     interrogation of network equipment.  It can be used on TCP/IP and
     CHAOSnet protocol stacks and implements basic host polling as well as
     SNMP.  Map was written by Michael A. Patton and comes with some
     documentation.  Map is available by anonymous FTP from `ftp.lcs.mit.edu'
     in the directory `nets'.

   * SIPP, the SImple Polygon Processor

     SIPP is a library for creating photorealistic renderings of 3D scenes.  A
     scene is built up of objects which can be transformed with rotation,
     translation and scaling.  The objects form hierarchies where each object
     can have arbitrarily many subobjects and subsurfaces.  A surface is a
     number of connected polygons which are rendered with either Phong,
     Gouraud or flat shading.  The library supports texture mapping with
     textures in up to 3-dimensions and automatic interpolation of texture
     coordinates. A scene can be illuminated by an arbitrary number of light
     sources.  The light from some of them are capable of casting shadows of
     objects.  You can FTP it from `isy.liu.se' (130.236.1.3) in file
     `/pub/sipp/sipp-3.1.tar.gz'.  For more information, contact the author
     Jonas Yngvesson, `jonas-y@isy.liu.se' Updated: May 94
