`T' is a Scheme variant developed at Yale.  It is available via anonymous
FTP from masala.lcs.mit.edu, directory /pub/t3.1.

Yale T is no longer available directly from the GNU Project, because it is
no longer maintained and we needed the space for other programs.  For more
information, please ask gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.
