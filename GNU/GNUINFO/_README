This directory is no longer a full GNU Emacs etc/ sub directory.
It contains a copy of the more useful informational files
distributed there, as well as useful files from elsewhere.

If you need another file from the GNU Emacs etc/ directory, you will
need to get ../emacs-NN.MM.tar.z and ungzip/untar it.

The files in this directory are not maintained here, send improvements
to:
